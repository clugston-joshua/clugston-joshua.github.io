## hello 
Mathematical models which include integer variables are ubiquitous in many contexts of significant importance within scientific inquiry. Such problems typically are empirically seen as much more difficult to solve than similar models containing only continuous real-valued variables *linear programs* (LPs) and *mixed-integer linear programs* (MILPs) \textit{mixed-integer nonlinear programs} (MINLPs)
