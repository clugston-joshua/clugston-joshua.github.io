As an Arizona native, I have spent the last five-odd years primarily as a student at Arizona State University, where, as an undergraduate I studied applied mathematics, and as a graduate student industrial engineering. In my free time I enjoy making the best of the diverse ecosystems that Arizona has to offer, by getting outside, exploring, hiking, and camping with my daughter, wife, and two dogs. When I am not hiking or spending time with my family, you will likely find me working on some exciting project. 

In the more recent past, my research projects have gravitated toward discrete optimization topics. Particularly, I have enjoyed investigating how distributed optimization techniques can be applied to very large problems with integer variables and nonlinearities; especially problems of general, real-world importance. Some of this work can be found throughout this website, either in [a blog-type post](https://clugston-joshua.github.io), or through the link to [my primary GitHub](https://github.com/JoshuaClugston).
