It is shown that such problems may be decomposed into a series of multi-parametric mixed-integer linear problems, of lower dimensionality, that are sequentially solved to obtain the globally optimal solution of the original problem. At each stage, the dynamic programming recursion is reformulated as a convex multi-parametric programming problem, therefore avoiding the need for global optimisation that usually arises in hard constrained problems. The proposed methodology is applied to a problem of mixed-integer linear nature that arises in the context of inventory scheduling. The example also highlights how the complexity of the original problem is reduced by using dynamic programming and multi-parametric programming.}

The expected optimal maintenance policy in this study should be able to minimize system maintenance cost while satisfying the system reliability requirements. Stochastic maintenance scheduling with an infinite horizon has not been investigated thoroughly in the literature. In this work, we formulate the maintenance optimization under uncertainties as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and solve it using a modified Reinforcement Learning method. A Linear Programming-enhanced RollouT (LPRT) is proposed, which considers both constrained deterministic and stochastic maintenance scheduling with an infinite horizon. The novelty of the proposed approach is that it is suitable for online maintenance scheduling, which can include random unexpected maintenance performance and system degradation. The proposed method is demonstrated with numerical examples and compared with several existing methods. Results show that LPRT is able to determine the suitable optimal maintenance policy efficiently compared with existing methods with similar accuracy. Parametric studies are used to investigate the effect of uncertainty, subproblem size, and the number of stochastic stages on the final maintenance cost. Limitations and future work are given based on the proposed study.}

abstract = {The paper considers a version of the vehicle routing problem where customers’ demands are uncertain. The focus is on dynamically routing a single vehicle to serve the demands of a known set of geographically dispersed customers during real-time operations. The goal consists of minimizing the expected distance traveled in order to serve all customers’ demands. Since actual demand is revealed upon arrival of the vehicle at the location of each customer, fully exploiting this feature requires a dynamic approach. This work studies the suitability of the emerging field of neuro-dynamic programming (NDP) in providing approximate solutions to this difficult stochastic combinatorial optimization problem. The paper compares the performance of two NDP algorithms: optimistic approximate policy iteration and a rollout policy. While the former improves the performance of a nearest-neighbor policy by 2.3%, the computational results indicate that the rollout policy generates higher quality solutions. The implication for the practitioner is that the rollout policy is a promising candidate for vehicle routing applications where a dynamic approach is required.
Scope and purpose
Recent years have seen a growing interest in the development of vehicle routing algorithms to cope with the uncertain and dynamic situations found in real-world applications (see the recent survey paper by Powell et al. [1]). As noted by Psaraftis [2], dramatic advances in information and communication technologies provide new possibilities and opportunities for vehicle routing research and applications. The enhanced capability of capturing the information that becomes available during real-time operations opens up new research directions. This informational availability provides the possibility of developing dynamic routing algorithms that take advantage of the information that is dynamically revealed during operations. Exploiting such information presents a significant challenge to the operations research/management science community. The single vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands [3] provides an example of a simple, yet very difficult to solve exactly, dynamic vehicle routing problem [2,p.157]. The problem can be formulated as a stochastic shortest path problem [4] characterized by an enormous number of states. Neuro-dynamic programming [5], [6] is a recent methodology that can be used to approximately solve very large and complex stochastic decision and control problems. In this spirit, this paper is meant to study the applicability of neuro-dynamic programming algorithms to the single-vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands.}

The resulting rollout policy appears to be the first computationally tractable algorithm for approximately solving the problem under the reoptimization approach. After describing the solution strategy and providing properties of the rollout policy, the policy behavior is analyzed by conducting a computational investigation. Depending on the quality of the initial solution, the rollout policy obtains 1% to 4% average improvements on the a priori approach with a reasonable computational effort.},

abstract={The deterministic vehicle routing problem (VRP) is well studied in the operations research literature. A set of customers, located on the nodes of a network, each asking a given amount of demand, has to be served by a vehicle of limited capacity. The objective is to route the vehicle such that all customers' demands are satisfied and the distance traveled is minimized. A variation of the problem where customers' demands are assumed to follow a given probability distribution is considered. The problem of finding a tour through the customers that minimizes expected distance traveled is defined as the stochastic vehicle routing problem (SVRP). In a deterministic setting, it is assumed that the vehicle always has enough capacity to satisfy all customers' demands. In a stochastic environment, this is not necessarily the case. A route failure is said to occur when the vehicle capacity becomes attained or exceeded at some customer location. In such a situation, different alternatives or recourse actions are available to the decision maker: the remaining customers may be served by a different vehicle, may be skipped, their service may be rescheduled for another day, or one may have the vehicle return to the depot, replenish, and resume its tour. Previous work in the literature has focused on computing a fixed order of customers' visitation, eventually supplemented by decision rules on when to return to the depot to replenish, in anticipation of route failures. Recourse actions are taken when a route failure occurs. This approach to SVRP treats the problem as a static one, whereby the order of customers' visitation is not changed during its real-time execution. Recomputing routes based on the information that becomes available during the execution of the tour, although more costly from a computational standpoint, should decrease the expected distance traveled. In this framework, the goal of this work is to develop computationally viable ways of computing in real-time a routing policy for SVRP. The problem is modeled as a stochastic shortest path, and different dynamic programming formulations are developed and analyzed. They are shown to be well behaved. State space decompositions, that allow to solve to optimality small size instances, are derived. For larger sizes, different heuristics are developed in order to compute sub-optimal policies. The significance of this work relies on its novelty, especially on the impact that its findings may have on the field of vehicle routing: the thesis proposes computationally viable ways of coming up with good solutions for a version of the problem that has so far been considered intractable.

abstract = {Expanding electrical transmission networks is a critical challenge faced by many developing economies. This process requires extensive investments, which must be strategically and methodically planned on a large scale, often encompassing regional or national considerations. Differing from typical Network Design Problems, efficiency in a transmission network can sometimes be enhanced by strategically deactivating certain transmission lines. Thanks to that, this paper focuses on a version of the transmission expansion planning problem that allows redesign during the network expansion. We propose using two exact methodologies as alternatives to the direct use of mixed integer programming formulations with commercial solvers. These methods are an application of Benders’ decomposition and a newly developed approach named Ring Space. Through comprehensive computational experiments, we assess and compare the efficacy of these methods against the conventional application of the mathematical formulation. Additionally, this study successfully obtained new high-quality solutions and proved their optimality for a subset of benchmark instances.}

While classification according to solution methods and coordination with other planning systems is an updated version of past literature studies, classification according to test systems has been comprehensively discussed for the first time in this literature review. In addition to the first-time classification of test systems, a detailed review and classification have been made for the IEEE 24 test system, which is found to be the most used test system in the TEP problem literature. The IEEE-24 test system is originally classified considering new transmission line alternatives, new stations, various demand incentive policies, generation alternatives, generation quantities, load amounts, and transmission line capacities. With this study, researchers will compare their proposed techniques with past studies in the literature, and their proposed methods' differences and specificities will be identified.}

abstract = {In this paper, system network planning expansion is formulated for mixed integer programming, a genetic algorithm (GA) and tabu search (TS). Compared with other optimization methods, GAs are suitable for traversing large search spaces, since they can do this relatively rapidly and because the use of mutation diverts the method away from local minima, which will tend to become more common as the search space increases in size. GA’s give an excellent trade off between solution quality and computing time and flexibility for taking into account specific constraints in real situations. TS has emerged as a new, highly efficient, search paradigm for finding quality solutions to combinatorial problems. It is characterized by gathering knowledge during the search and subsequently profiting from this knowledge. The attractiveness of the technique comes from its ability to escape local optimality. The cost function of this problem consists of the capital investment cost in discrete form, the cost of transmission losses and the power generation costs. The DC load flow equations for the network are embedded in the constraints of the mathematical model to avoid sub-optimal solutions that can arise if the enforcement of such constraints is done in an indirect way. The solution of the model gives the best line additions and also provides information regarding the optimal generation at each generation point. This method of solution is demonstrated on the expansion of a 10 bus bar system to 18 bus bars. Finally, a steady-state genetic algorithm is employed rather than generational replacement, also uniform crossover is used.}

abstract = {Globally, the power sector must undergo a profound transition to achieve the decarbonization development targets. Various roadmaps are implemented, but only from a macro perspective, lacking the consideration of the electricity market rules. In this paper, we develop and present a market-driven generation and transmission expansion planning (MGTEP) model considering the effectiveness of the electricity market. Specifically, generation and transmission companies incorporate hourly market trading and annual capacity investment into strategic decisions to maximize their profits, with the supply function equilibrium model to analyze bidding behaviors. An equivalent quadratic programming formulation is deployed to solve the trilevel MGTEP model. Meanwhile, the MGTEP model is coupled with decarbonization policies to support the state and federal government in assessing energy transition strategies. We implement the MGTEP model with carbon emission allowance and carbon tax policies for the southern China electricity market to achieve carbon peaking by 2030. Carbon emission allowance adopts an intensity-based cap based on generation companies' historical output. The case study results show that 50 % carbon emission allowance or 400 CNY/t carbon tax is required but with several drawbacks, including unsatisfactory decarbonization effect, excessive economic sacrifice, etc. Finally, the case study is extended to dual-track policies with different combinations of policies. An optimal combination is 70 % carbon emission allowance and 160 CNY/t carbon tax. In this case, the power sector's carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices in the southern China electricity market would increase to 554.6 Mt and 864.34 CNY/MWh in 2030, respectively, along with a carbon price of 850 CNY/t.}

abstract = {Wind power is an intermittent energy source that behaves quite differently than conventional energy sources. Bulk electric system reliability analysis associated with wind energy conversion systems (WECS) provides an opportunity to investigate the reliability benefits when large-scale wind power is injected at specified locations in a bulk electric system. Connecting the WECS to different locations in a bulk system can have different impacts on the overall system reliability depending on the system topology and conditions. Connecting a large-scale WECS to an area which has weak transmission could create system operating constraints and provide less system benefit than connecting it to an area with stronger transmission. This paper investigates bulk electric system transmission constraints associated with large-scale wind farms. The analyses presented in this paper can be used to determine the maximum WECS installed capacity that can be injected at specified locations in a bulk electric system, and assist system planners to create potential transmission reinforcement schemes to facilitate large-scale WECS additions to the bulk system. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation approach is used as this methodology can facilitate a time series modeling of wind speeds, and also provides accurate frequency and duration assessments. An auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) time series model is used to simulate hourly wind speeds.}

Because of modeling simplifications and future uncertainties, no single model can capture all aspects of transmission expansion planning. Instead, sensitivities and trends should be compared across multiple models and the results combined with broader contextual information.}
