Through extensive computational experiments, our heuristic algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to existing heuristics, producing optimal or near-optimal solutions for even the most demanding QKP instances.

It is shown that such problems may be decomposed into a series of multi-parametric mixed-integer linear problems, of lower dimensionality, that are sequentially solved to obtain the globally optimal solution of the original problem. At each stage, the dynamic programming recursion is reformulated as a convex multi-parametric programming problem, therefore avoiding the need for global optimisation that usually arises in hard constrained problems. The proposed methodology is applied to a problem of mixed-integer linear nature that arises in the context of inventory scheduling. The example also highlights how the complexity of the original problem is reduced by using dynamic programming and multi-parametric programming.}

abstract = {Maintenance is of great importance for the safety and integrity of infrastructures. The expected optimal maintenance policy in this study should be able to minimize system maintenance cost while satisfying the system reliability requirements. Stochastic maintenance scheduling with an infinite horizon has not been investigated thoroughly in the literature. In this work, we formulate the maintenance optimization under uncertainties as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and solve it using a modified Reinforcement Learning method. A Linear Programming-enhanced RollouT (LPRT) is proposed, which considers both constrained deterministic and stochastic maintenance scheduling with an infinite horizon. The novelty of the proposed approach is that it is suitable for online maintenance scheduling, which can include random unexpected maintenance performance and system degradation. The proposed method is demonstrated with numerical examples and compared with several existing methods. Results show that LPRT is able to determine the suitable optimal maintenance policy efficiently compared with existing methods with similar accuracy. Parametric studies are used to investigate the effect of uncertainty, subproblem size, and the number of stochastic stages on the final maintenance cost. Limitations and future work are given based on the proposed study.}

abstract = {The paper considers a version of the vehicle routing problem where customers’ demands are uncertain. The focus is on dynamically routing a single vehicle to serve the demands of a known set of geographically dispersed customers during real-time operations. The goal consists of minimizing the expected distance traveled in order to serve all customers’ demands. Since actual demand is revealed upon arrival of the vehicle at the location of each customer, fully exploiting this feature requires a dynamic approach. This work studies the suitability of the emerging field of neuro-dynamic programming (NDP) in providing approximate solutions to this difficult stochastic combinatorial optimization problem. The paper compares the performance of two NDP algorithms: optimistic approximate policy iteration and a rollout policy. While the former improves the performance of a nearest-neighbor policy by 2.3%, the computational results indicate that the rollout policy generates higher quality solutions. The implication for the practitioner is that the rollout policy is a promising candidate for vehicle routing applications where a dynamic approach is required.
Scope and purpose
Recent years have seen a growing interest in the development of vehicle routing algorithms to cope with the uncertain and dynamic situations found in real-world applications (see the recent survey paper by Powell et al. [1]). As noted by Psaraftis [2], dramatic advances in information and communication technologies provide new possibilities and opportunities for vehicle routing research and applications. The enhanced capability of capturing the information that becomes available during real-time operations opens up new research directions. This informational availability provides the possibility of developing dynamic routing algorithms that take advantage of the information that is dynamically revealed during operations. Exploiting such information presents a significant challenge to the operations research/management science community. The single vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands [3] provides an example of a simple, yet very difficult to solve exactly, dynamic vehicle routing problem [2,p.157]. The problem can be formulated as a stochastic shortest path problem [4] characterized by an enormous number of states. Neuro-dynamic programming [5], [6] is a recent methodology that can be used to approximately solve very large and complex stochastic decision and control problems. In this spirit, this paper is meant to study the applicability of neuro-dynamic programming algorithms to the single-vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands.}

While most of the literature has studied the a priori solution approach, this work focuses on computing a reoptimization-type routing policy. This is obtained by sequentially improving a given a priori solution by means of a rollout algorithm. The resulting rollout policy appears to be the first computationally tractable algorithm for approximately solving the problem under the reoptimization approach. After describing the solution strategy and providing properties of the rollout policy, the policy behavior is analyzed by conducting a computational investigation. Depending on the quality of the initial solution, the rollout policy obtains 1% to 4% average improvements on the a priori approach with a reasonable computational effort.},

abstract={The deterministic vehicle routing problem (VRP) is well studied in the operations research literature. A set of customers, located on the nodes of a network, each asking a given amount of demand, has to be served by a vehicle of limited capacity. The objective is to route the vehicle such that all customers' demands are satisfied and the distance traveled is minimized. A variation of the problem where customers' demands are assumed to follow a given probability distribution is considered. The problem of finding a tour through the customers that minimizes expected distance traveled is defined as the stochastic vehicle routing problem (SVRP). In a deterministic setting, it is assumed that the vehicle always has enough capacity to satisfy all customers' demands. In a stochastic environment, this is not necessarily the case. A route failure is said to occur when the vehicle capacity becomes attained or exceeded at some customer location. In such a situation, different alternatives or recourse actions are available to the decision maker: the remaining customers may be served by a different vehicle, may be skipped, their service may be rescheduled for another day, or one may have the vehicle return to the depot, replenish, and resume its tour. Previous work in the literature has focused on computing a fixed order of customers' visitation, eventually supplemented by decision rules on when to return to the depot to replenish, in anticipation of route failures. Recourse actions are taken when a route failure occurs. This approach to SVRP treats the problem as a static one, whereby the order of customers' visitation is not changed during its real-time execution. Recomputing routes based on the information that becomes available during the execution of the tour, although more costly from a computational standpoint, should decrease the expected distance traveled. In this framework, the goal of this work is to develop computationally viable ways of computing in real-time a routing policy for SVRP. The problem is modeled as a stochastic shortest path, and different dynamic programming formulations are developed and analyzed. They are shown to be well behaved. State space decompositions, that allow to solve to optimality small size instances, are derived. For larger sizes, different heuristics are developed in order to compute sub-optimal policies. The significance of this work relies on its novelty, especially on the impact that its findings may have on the field of vehicle routing: the thesis proposes computationally viable ways of coming up with good solutions for a version of the problem that has so far been considered intractable.
